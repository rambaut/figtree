_FigTree_

FigTree is designed as a graphical viewer of phylogenetic trees and as a program for producing publication-ready figures. As with most of my programs, it was written for my own needs so may not be as polished and feature-complete as a commercial program. In particular it is designed to display summarized and annotated trees produced by BEAST.

## Instructions

1. Install [Apache Ant](https://ant.apache.org/) (can be installed with Homebrew).
2. Run `ant`.
3. Start FigTree by running `java -Xmx10G -jar dist/figtree.jar`.
